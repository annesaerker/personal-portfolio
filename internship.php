                        I spent my last internship at Njord Nutrition, which at the time was a start-up company. Njord Nutrition is a 
                        company that sells personalized dietary supplements, and differentiate themselves from other similar companies 
                        by having a modern and Scandinavian inspired visual identity and packaging for their products. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my internship, my main responsibility was updating and developing sections of Njord's WordPress website. 
                        My assignments included:
                        <br>• Re-designing and implementing a new layout and appearance of the websites content.
                        <br>• Create new streamlined icons that visualize text content.
                        <br>• Develop images that showcased their products and their concept. 
                    </p>   
                </div>
            </div>

                    <p>
                        Later in my internship when Njord received their first products, I took on the responsibility of being in charge of 
                        taking pictures of the products and editing them for their website. I also produced 10 new labels for products that weren’t launched yet 
                        and was tasked with creating label templates that could be used after my departure.
