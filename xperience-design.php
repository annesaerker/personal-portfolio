                        Legends of the sea was a project we developed for our course in X-perience Design. 
                        The given assignment was to create a solution that extends the museum experience with a digital universe. 
                        We had to work with a three staged experience: before, during and after the visit to the museum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our concept was a non-fictional universe, building new learning experience onto the museums exhibits. 
                        This extra layer was supposed to be for children and was to consist of video mapping on the exhibits, 
                        with stories and a gaming app to match. The purpose of this extra layer was to make the exhibits more 
                        relevant to children. We wanted to give children the opportunity to get closer to what life as a sailor was like. 
                        We wanted an atmosphere that was a little creepy, dangerous, mysterious and exciting. The atmosphere was supposed 
                        to reflect the real dangers sailors feared.

                        Our three staged experience consisted of the website as a before element, the exhibition elements as a during 
                        element and an gaming app (prototype), consisting of the exhibition elements from the museum.
